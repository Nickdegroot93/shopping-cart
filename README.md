### About the project

This project was created as an assignement from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/shopping-cart). The goal was to familiarize myself with the basics of React and some of its key features. I've used the Context API in combination with useReducer for the shopping cart data. The menu data is being fetched from a realtime database using Firebase. For the user form I used a third party library React-Hook-Form, and for styling I went with CSS Modules as it seemed like a good way to avoid name conflicts.
